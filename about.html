        <p class="text-center">About</p>
        <p class="text-center">My name is Gaurav Kale, and I'm a Silicon Valley dropout</p>
        <p class="text-center">This website both showcases some WebXR projects of mine, and shows you how to make your own as well</p>
        <!--<p class="indent-20">Ever since I made my first website that used WebGL via three.js in the summer of 2019, my brain couldn't stop imagining the future of the internet. After throwing VR into the mix, the possibilities of how content can be served and how people interact with each other and data too became endless. My brain/imagination basically exploded and WebXR has been my main focus ever since</p>-->
        <p class="indent-20">Remember the internet in the late 90s? It was sooooo different than it is now. That's because of all the amazing individuals that came up with ingenious ways to serve content on a 2 dimensional screen. I want this website to be place for people to experience what's now possible on the web, and to inspire people to experiment for themselves and become one of the ingenious creatives of our time when it comes to serving content in 3D</p>
        <!--<p class="text-center">Welcome to the beginnings of an ambitious project. A place, or rather an idea in the making that experiments with changing the social layout of the internet. Half Baked City</p>
        <p class="text-center">The present purpose of this website is to introduce people to interactive 3D content and provide tutorials to enable individuals to start making their own 3D content. See below for our vision</p>
        <p>Phase 1</p>
        <p class="indent-20">Our website will showcase VR friendly interactive 3D media to users via our applications. The remainder of the site will be 2D as there's still so much to discover in serving interactive 3D content. That is why this phase features tutorials, to enable creative individuals to start making content for the immersive web. We need more people creating brand new ideas to see what works and what doesn't work in 3D for users. Remember the internet at the beginning of the century? It was a completely different place than it is now because of all the amazing individuals that came up with ingenious ways to serve content on a 2D screen. We'd like to enable you to become one of the ingenious creatives of our time</p>
      <p>Phase 2</p>
      <p class="indent-20">This is the phase where we begin to replace all 2D content with 3D content based on the new techniques developed during phase 1. The phase will be a very long and messy process, but we're excited to get here and fledge things out as time goes on in Phase 1</p>
      <p>Phase 3</p>
      <p class="indent-20">In the not too distant future, you'll be here, and your friend will be here too or possibly a stranger if you so choose. You won't have to be alone when you visit this screen, or you can be if you choose. This won't be like any website where you're here and can message other people and see stuff they write. You'll be experiencing everything with them in real time. Half Baked City won't be Half Baked anymore. We can't wait to meet you then</p>-->
